The website that I build seeks to organize and modernize the following webisite......http://www.andrewfullercenter.org/   

The Andrew Fuller Center is a ministry of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary

The "REVIEWS" and "CONTACT" pages are responsive with Flex. The contacts page has a Twitter feed of a list of Southern Seminary Twitter feeds. The contacts page also has a YouTube embed of the 2014 Andrew Fuller Conference. Both have user usability. 

The "CONTRABUTIONS" page is the blog posts that are accessible via the dropdown menu by the user. This then gets the information from the .js files and loads it to the page. All this is done with Angular.js. The dropdown menu at the top accesses the individual years (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). I entered a few posts from each year to showcase the functionalbility of each page.

Both the Nav panel at the top and the footer at the bottom are fixed.
